## Abstract

For insurers, itâ€™s important to develop models that accurately forecast medical expenses so that they can make money. Through this project, we aim at pretending to work for insurance companies and build different models to best predict the medical cost of individuals given their basic information. Also, through different methods, the article tries to detect inner relationship among different dependent variables to help better understand the impact of different variables on the medical charges. The final prediction result can be used as a benchmark for the insurance company to establish appropriate insurance claim coverage for their contractors.

We first applied linear regression models to find significant variables to help predict the medical charges. By adding interaction variables, changing the continuous variable to be categorical variable, we fit several different linear regression models. We detected the abnormality of residuals. We raised some hypothesis and did several tests to try to explain this issue.

We also used random forest method to better forecast the charges of individuals and find the importance of different variables.

After that, we applied K-Means to cluster the individuals and try to find some statistical differences among different groups, further confirming what key variables have a very large impact on charges.
